          <h2>Macronutrients or Macros</h2>
          <p>
            Macronutrients, or macros, are essential nutrients the body needs in
            large quantities to remain healthy. Macronutrients provide the body
            with energy, help prevent disease, and allow the body to function
            correctly. There are three main types of macronutrients: proteins,
            fats, and carbohydrates.
          </p>
          <h3>Importance of macronutrients</h3>
          <p>
            Each type of macronutrient performs an important role in keeping the
            body healthy. For optimum health, people typically require a balance
            of macronutrients.
          </p>
          <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
          <p>
            Carbohydrates are a preferred source of energy for several body
            tissues, and the primary energy source for the brain. The body can
            break carbohydrates down into glucose, which moves from the
            bloodstream into the bodyâ€™s cells and allows them to function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carbohydrates are important for muscle contraction during intense
            exercise. Even at rest, carbohydrates enable the body to perform
            vital functions such as maintaining body temperature, keeping the
            heart beating, and digesting food.
          </p>
          <h3>Proteins</h3>
          <p>
            Protein consists of long chains of compounds called amino acids.
            These play an essential role in the growth, development, repair, and
            maintenance of body tissues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Protein is present in every body cell, and adequate protein intake
            is important for keeping the muscles, bones, and tissues healthy.
            Protein also plays a vital role in many bodily processes, such as
            aiding the immune system, biochemical reactions, and providing
            structure and support for cells.
          </p>
          <h3>Fats</h3>
          <p>
            Fats are an important part of the diet that can also provide the
            body with energy. While some types of dietary fats may be healthier
            than others, they are an essential part of the diet and play a
            roleTrusted Source in hormone production, cell growth, energy
            storage, and the absorption of important vitamins.

          <h2>TDEE(Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</h2>
          <p>
            Energy expenditure is the amount of energy that a person needs to
            carry out physical functions such as breathing, circulating blood,
            digesting food, or exercising. Energy is measured in calories, and
            your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is the number of calories
            you burn each day.
          </p>
          <h3>How TDEE is Calculated</h3>
          <p>
            Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how
            many calories you burn per day when exercise is taken into account.
            It is calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate,
            then multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at
            rest, it is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for
            the calories you burn during the day. This is true even for those
            with a sedentary lifestyle. Our TDEE calculator uses the best
            formulas and displays your score in a way that's easy to read and
            meaningful.
